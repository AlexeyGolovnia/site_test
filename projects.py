    I developed a real-time machine learning model that identifies document types using camera data.\
    If the document type was initially undetermined, the model dynamically retrained itself on new data in real-time.\
    Captured data was transmitted to a server for further user verification, enhancing document recognition accuracy and enabling secure and efficient user authentication processes.\
    This adaptive learning approach ensured continuous improvement and reliability of document identification.",
